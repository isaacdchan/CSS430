1) Virtual machines and containers are a way to simulate multiple computers on hardware designed for a single computer. While virtual machines rely on the hypervisor to create the virtualized components of each simulated computer (processor, RAM, storage). With containers, the OS is responsible for partitioning the existing hardware into "sections" by setting the namespace, root, networking, and group permissions, of each section.
2) You would want to use virtual machine's when you wanted maximum fidelity when interacting with the virtual OS. You would use containers when you wanted to maximize efficient usage of your host machine's resources
